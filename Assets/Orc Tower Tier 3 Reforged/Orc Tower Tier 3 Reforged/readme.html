<h2>Description</h2>
<p><b>Watch Tower<br />
</b><br />
Rising high above the treeline, Watch Towers resemble primitive huts laced with animal bones and giant tusks of every kind. These insubstantial - but highly useful - lookout posts are ideal for spotting the cowardly and deceitful <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Human" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Human</a> forces from above, making them a desired part of any <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Orc" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Orcish</a> settlement&#039;s defenses. These emplacements may be upgraded to loose deadly projectiles upon any approaching enemies, or to rain explosive death down upon their foes on land and sea...<br />
