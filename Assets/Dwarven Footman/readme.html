<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This was a request, a Dwarven Footman, Uses the riflemans body, the hair of dwarf b of mortar team, a piece of helm from the gryphon rider, the mountain kings shield and weapon. Slim pickings for dwarven units in game, so i think these additions would be useful. Has some Footman animations and of course the Defend. I have also done an little Icon for it, so hope you all enjoy.<br />
<br />
Added and Fixed a more TC version</p>
