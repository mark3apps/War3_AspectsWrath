<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I've been hoarding this model for a while now, so I thought why not share it?<br />
<br />
I've made it work good enough for my purposes so if you want to use it, but if it has a problem, don't hesitate to post a comment or a dm. I'll gladly try to adjust it when I have some free time.<br />
<br />
Made in Magos. This is an extra fat version.<br />
<br />
Edit: I noticed there are some glitchies in the hive model previewer. I am not experiencing those in game/WE so in case you do, leave a comment I'll try to fix it.<br />
