<h2>Description</h2>
<p><i><b>&quot;Death to all who oppose the Horde!&quot;</b></i><br />
<br />
In the past, the chieftain of an orc clan was also the warlord of the same.<br />
But it could also happen that the Warchief of the Horde named a Slayer who performed great deeds on behalf of the Horde as a warlord and was thus granted control of an orc clan.<br />
Either way, a warlord leads his clan&#039;s armies by example. In the first row, there where the ground is covered with blood, shouting war cries, he hacks his way through every land-based resistance with beastly strength.<br />
<br />
Actually, I just wanted to get the orc warlord off his horse, but then decided against it because of the really ugly texturing and built my own from scratch.<br />
Thanks to<span style="font-size: 15px"><b><a href="https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/bagysta.228506/" class="internalLink"> </a></b><a href="https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/bagysta.228506/" class="internalLink">Bagysta</a></span> for letting me use his texture and a big thank you to<span style="font-size: 15px"><a href="https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/archaos.288660/" class="internalLink"> Archaos</a></span>, who helped me with words and deeds to give the warlord a new animation set and how to fix glitching geosets!<br />
<i>Thank you very much.<br />
</i><br />
<b>Update:<br />
I fixed the problem with mutually exclusive portrait animations. Unfortunately I haven&#039;t been able to figure out how to upload facefx_ingame files here yet. Use these links here to download the files. It should be self-explanatory which file is for which model ^^.</b><br />

Just upload it with the other files in the editor and remove the war3mapImported \ in front of it and it should work.</i></p>
