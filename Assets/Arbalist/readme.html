<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So... yeah, there&#039;s apparently not a single crossbowman in Warcraft 3. I thought to myself: well, maybe the riflemen could be a nice base model. And boy, it was.<br />
<br />
Changed the height, the weapon, every single animation (ugh), the collision spheres, the geosets... It has TC, an icon, a working attack animation.<br />
<br />
Has no custom textures.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, to import this model, make sure to set these values (<b>both violet and black</b>):<br />

Black values are the same as the archer. You can base the unit with the archer model to save some time.<br />
<br />
Also, he has 2 different attack animations: Attack One (against ground units) and Attack Two (against air units).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Known bugs:</b><br />
-He has the random blood bug from many imported units that had the .mdl changed. It&#039;s not gamebreaking by any means (when you pick an imported unit, a blood spout forms in the center of the map for no reason at all).<br />
<br />
<br />

<b>UPDATE: </b>(9-11-2020) 12:15<br />
Thanks to the user @Z1003 the model now has a proper FaceFx, although he needs to be scaled to 1.15-1.2 to be the size of a footman. Reupdated the model. It works ingame with the bandit sound set. (Make sure to rep @Z1003 for helping others)<br />
