<h2>Description</h2>
<p>originally inspired by a WOW model, this one is going to be featured in our WC2 remake for the Stormwind destroyed cathedral, but I thought I could share this model for the good people of hive in their project however they see fit! as long as credits are given due.<br />
<br />
<br />
making these models takes a lot of effort, please support me at my patreon page which can be found in my profile or signature for more custom models <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /></p>
