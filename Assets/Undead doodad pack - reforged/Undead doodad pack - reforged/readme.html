<h2>Description</h2>
<p>We got some really nice useful extra doodads with reforged mainly the human, Dalaran and Silvermoon city doodads but we got very little for the orc and nothing for the undead and night elf. So here is my undead doodad pack.<br />
<br />
I know it&#039;s a simple edit but I needed it as a temple for my project (Preview Image) and it took time so I thought it could be useful for other map makers who need doodads for undercity/azol<br />
<br />
-Edit. Added the Haunted Goldmine Cover as requested.</p>
