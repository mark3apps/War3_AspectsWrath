<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hi guys, those are some module parts of HD war3 that I found pretty useful for environment artists. I have been working on Quenching mod with my friends for a year, and I have a small collection of helpful prop models that I want to share. Those are just simply parts of the existing blizzard models, but I found them extremely helpful.<br />
<br />
There is a simple guide on how to use them.<br />
<br />
<b>First, thanks a lot for ReterasModelStudio which saves me tons of time to make those models.<br />
<br />
Second, those are for terrain arts only, it&#039;s pretty hard to use them for actual building cause they don&#039;t have real animation.<br />
<br />
<b>Third, </b>you don&#039;t need any extra textures, all of them used default textures.<br />
<br />
<b>Fourth, better to use click helper for those modules.</b></b><br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the list for everything in this pack.<br />
<br />
orcprops_arch1<br />
orcprops_arch2<br />
orcprops_arch3<br />
orcprops_door<br />
orcprops_dooropen<br />
orcprops_horn1<br />
orcprops_horn2<br />
orcprops_horn3<br />
orcprops_horn4<br />
orcprops_smallhunt<br />
orcprops_tower<br />
orcprops_well<br />
orcprops_wellbare<br />
orcprops_workhouse<br />
<br />
There is a part II orc props, you can see some examples in screenshots of how to use them. Have fun!</p>
