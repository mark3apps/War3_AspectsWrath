<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So, I noticed how there were still no air elementals in WcReforged, but the enraged elemental did have a whirlwind. So I decided to change its animated texture to another one (used the waterfall for this) and, since I disliked the purple colour, I did a small recolour of the texture to make it more &quot;windy&quot;.<br />
<br />
I then thought &quot;hey, I should try with geoset importing (I&#039;m quite new with Retera&#039;s model editor)&quot; so I got his papa a fancy new pair of shoulderpads.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tempest elemental shares the same texture as the air elemental, but his animated texture moves twice as fast, so you can tell them apart easily (he has some minor facial tweaks as well). Either way, I wanted it to look gloomier, so I just darkened it in Wc Editor (Screenshot has this values: R160,G140,B200)<br />
*Although the braces and the shoulderpads look quite different in RMS, they actually look very similar inside Warcraft. Yeah, I don&#039;t know why either, but it saved me quite some time of UV mapping.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comes with their icons and portrait/portrait-talks. You may not be able to make them talk if you don&#039;t put them in a copy of enraged elemental/berserker elemental.<br />
Remember to write *ReplaceableTextures\CommandButtonsDisabled\* before DISBTNicon.blp.<br />
<br />

*Ignore the model viewer of Hive, it&#039;s messed up. Works fine ingame.</p>
